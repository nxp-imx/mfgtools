  - Multi devices program support

  - Few depedencies (only libusb, zlibc, libbz2)
  - Firmware (uboot/kernel) uses WCID to auto load the winusb driver
    on the Windows side. Windows7 users need to install the winusb driver
    from [https://zadig.akeo.ie/](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) Windows10 will
    install the driver automatically.
